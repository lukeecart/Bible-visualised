To keep the forked repository in sync with mine use `git remote add upstream https://github.com/lukeecart/FamilyTree.git`
Then use `git fetch upstream` then `git rebase upstream/master`. This is great as it keeps your code in sync with mine.

This will open a new page for you to add a description and then push the request.
